  <h1>Dynamic Fractals in Javascript</h1>

  <p>This application renders iterative fractals.  The fractals come from a
  repeated operation of drawing shapes, then smaller shapes around those, and
  so on.  After a few steps, this repeated process will generate a lot of
  shapes.  If each shape were drawn individually, the rendering of the fractal
  would take along time, minutes or hours.  This program uses a dynamic
  programming technique to speed up the rendering, so billions or more shapes
  can be drawn in just a fraction of a second.</p>

  <h2>Dynamic Programming</h2>

  <p>So, how do you draw over a billion shapes in the time it takes to
  blink?</p>

  <p>The key is dynamic programming.  That is a term used in computer science
  meaning that the result of some computational work is reused in repeated
  operations.  In this case, the repeated work is drawing all the shapes.  Look
  at the fractal, and see that the smallest shapes are the most repeated.  The
  work to draw them is also the most reused.  The small shape was drawn only
  once, then copied all around.  First the one small shape was copied into two,
  then the two were copied into four, then eight, sixteen, and so on.  Over
  four billion shapes can be made with just thirty two copying steps.  The
  program will copy two, three, or more at a time, depending on the branch
  factor.</p>

  <h2>Controls</h2>

  <p><strong>Fractal Depth:</strong> number of times to repeat drawing smaller
  and smaller shapes.</p>

  <p><strong>Branch Factor:</strong> number of smaller shapes to draw at each
  step.</p>

  <p><strong>Translate:</strong> the distance to move the smaller shape away
  from the center of the larger shape.</p>

  <p><strong>Scale:</strong> the size of the shape relative to the larger
  shape.</p>

  <p><strong>Rotate:</strong> the orientation of the smaller shape relative to
  the larger shape.</p>

  <p><strong>Off-screen Borders:</strong> show borders of the off-screen
  rendering used for dynamic programming.</p>
