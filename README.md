# Dynamic Fractals in Javascript

This application renders iterative fractals.  The fractals come from a repeated
operation of drawing shapes, then smaller shapes around those, and so on.
After a few steps, this repeated process will generate a lot of shapes.  If
each shape were drawn individually, the rendering of the fractal would take
along time, minutes or hours.  This program uses a dynamic programming
technique to speed up the rendering, so billions or more shapes can be drawn in
just a fraction of a second.
